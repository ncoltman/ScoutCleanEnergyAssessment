Create a repository on Github to host python code for this data analysis test. Please commit to the repository multiple times throughout the assignment.

Make a program to read tabular data in the file and check for missing timestamps.

The program must output a dataset without any missing timestamps, and an additional “timestamp flag” column to indicate if the row is “missing from original input dataset”.

Check for Erroneous values: the program must append a column for “data qc flag VTWS_AVG” and state “Erroneous” in each row where VTWS_AVG is missing.

A tip is to use the Pandas, datetime, and pytz libraries to write concise steps.

Send the URL to the Github repository when complete.
